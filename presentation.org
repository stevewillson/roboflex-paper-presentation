* Introduction - Problem
** Introduction
*** MoveIt - Software library for motion planning

*** MoveIt Advantages:
- Widely adopted - used by NASA, Google, Microsoft, etc
- Easy to setup for new robots - 150 robots available
- Easy to integrate with a ROS enabled system
- Actively developed with large community

*** MoveIt Disadvantages:
- Difficult to use / modify code

*** Roboflex simplifies the use of MoveIt and creates a high-level API for common use-cases while exposing underlying structures

* Contribution - Robowflex Software Library
** Robowflex Software Library
*** Roboflex is a software library that leverages the MoveIt library and Robot Operating System (ROS)
- Provides an API for MoveIt 

*** Primary Uses
- Developing new motion planners
- Evaluating motion planners
- Constructing complex problems that use motion planning
  
*** Also provides visualization capabilities

* Robowflex Library Overview
** Design Goals
*** Goals
- Clarity of Interface - use motion planning concepts for interface design
- Minimize ROS - encapsulate ROS to enable writing independent programs
- Leverage MoveIt's Ubiquity - robots supported in MoveIt are also supported in Robowflex
- Unrestricted Access and Integration - provide way to access all underlying features
- Consistency Across Versions - Robowflex code is not tied to a specific version of ROS (Melodic or Noetic)

** Roboflex Design
*** Robowflex provides wrappers around core MoveIt features

*** Primary Building Blocks
- Representation of the robot's kinematics
- Collision environment
- Motion planner

** Robowflex Core Modules
*** Core Modules
- Input and Output - provides the ability to handle ROS packages, XML files, and YAML files
- Robot Kinematics - loads appropriate files to configure a robot without requiring a MoveIt launch file
- Collision Environment - hanldes loading collision environments
- Motion Planner - plugin-based system to load a motion planning pipeline
- Robowflex Scripting - loads MoveIt's internal structures in the Robowflex program, provides access to the structures in these programs
- Integrations - provides compatability with other robotics libraries through auxiliary modules
  - Examples OMPL and DART

* Use Cases
** Use Cases
*** Benchmarking
- Can be used to benchmark motion planners using various scenes

*** Task and Motion Planning
- Enables use of many instances of robots, scenes, and motion planners within the same script

*** Robonaut 2 (NASA)
- Used Robowflex to evaluate motion plans for a robot that will move across the International Space Station

* Summary
** Summary
*** Robowflex Software Library
- Provides an augmented API to build motion planning queries through a single program
*** Core Advantage over MoveIt
- Ability to easily access and modify core data structures within the program itself
